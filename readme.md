A client for ArangoDB compiled as an extension for PHP.

## Description

ArangoDB-PHP-Driver is a PHP client for ArangoDB written as C-extension for language.  
This project is still in **work in progress (WIP)**, so some features are still being implemented.

## Requirements

* **PHP 7+**
* **PHP-json extension**

## Installation

You can use the installation scripts under `install`.  
Note that this driver is still in development, so **do not use in production**.

### Debian, Ubuntu, Mint and other Debian-based distros  

You must download the shared library in `ext/modules` and install in your PHP environment. Remember to add the shared library in your `php.ini` file and restart your web server.

### Fedora, CentOS or RHEL

Use the Fedora installation script:  
`sudo chmod a+x install\fedora\install.sh`  
`sudo ./install\fedora\install.sh`

## Development

While the driver is still being implemented, you can install it from this repository using the Zephir language tools.
To help you with this task, there are two configuration scripts in `config` directory. They will install Zephir parser and Zephir language in your environment.

### Debian, Ubuntu, Mint and other Debian-based distros

Use the Debian environment installation script:  
`sudo chmod a+x environment\debian\install.sh`  
`sudo ./environment\debian\install.sh`

### Fedora, CentOS or RHEL

Use the Fedora environment installation script:  
`sudo chmod a+x environment\fedora\install.sh`  
`sudo ./environment\fedora\install.sh`

The next step is to clone this repository:

`git clone https://github.com/lucassouzavieira/arangodb-php-driver.git`  

At this point, your environment should already be ready to develop. To compile the extension, use the command:

`cd arangodb-php-driver/`  
`sudo zephir build` (Because the extension is also added in your `php.ini` file)
